## Background
* This document describes the BFC format that is used to exchange topics, such as, issues, scenes, etc. between different BIM software.

## BCF file structure
In the root of the BCF file is an XML file defining project related information. The name of this file is project.xml. This file follows the project.xsd schema.

A BCF file is a zip containing one folder for each topic. The folder name is the GUID of the topic. This GUID is in the UUID form. The folder contains the following files:

* project.bcfp (optional)
    - An XML file referencing the extension.xsd to a project.
* markup.bcf
    * An XML file following the markup.xsd schema that is described below.
* viewpoint.bcfv
    * An XML file following the visinfo.xsd schema that is described below (for compatibility with BCF 1.0).
    * Multiple viewpoints are possible in BCF 2.0. Names of these files are not predefined.
* snapshot.png 
    *  A snapshot related to the topic (for compatibility with BCF 1.0).
Multiple snapshots are possible in BCF 2.0. Names of these files are not predefined.


*Note: The elements in the XML files must appear in the order given in the schemas and described below.*

## Project (.bcfp) file

The project file contains reference information about the project the topics belong to.
